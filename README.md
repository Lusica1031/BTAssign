# BTAssign

Offical repo to implement F2F bonding terminal assignment algorithms based on [FastRoute](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/grt)

Algorithm description:

*Siting Liu, Jiaxi Jiang, Zhuolun He, Ziyi Wang, Yibo Lin, Bei Yu, Martin Wong, 
“Routing-aware Legal Hybrid Bonding Terminal Assignment for 3D Face-to-Face Stacked ICs”,
ACM International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD), Taipei, Mar. 12–15, 2024.*

#### Additional Package Requirement
ortools: [Install](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/cpp)  (Recommend: binary installation)

#### Code Structure
grt - BTAssign, which is integrated into FastRoute.
parser - make the netlist generated by Cadence Genus can be used in the contest binaries.

#### BTAssign
The key implementation can refer to grt/src/quadtree.cpp.

#### Usage
Replace the [FastRoute](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/grt) in OpenROAD, and directly use the OpenROAD framework.
